## Instructions

Click on 'Add new note' and add in a title, description, and rate the importance of your task. Finish your note by clicking the checkmark. 

##### Task importance
The note will appear based on your indicated level of importance. High, medium, and low importance tasks will appear on the top, middle, and bottom rows respectively. 

##### Task status
All new tasks will apear with the status 'incomplete'. Once you have completed your task, you can click on the status indicator to toggle the task to complete. Alternatively, you can delete the note entirely by clicking the trash icon located on the top-right of each note. 

## Personal Notes
This project was made at the end of my 3rd week of The Odin Project.
##### Skills practiced
For this project, I mainly focused on using object constructors to create new notes. Continued to practice HTML/CSS/Javascript (DOM & event handlers). Re-used the same dark theme from the soundboard project to save time while maintaining a decent UI.
